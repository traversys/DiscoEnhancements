# DiscoEnhancements for BMC Discovery
## Version 1.4
### traversys.io

This modest extension aims to bring some useful enhancements to the Discovery UI

Supports version 11+ of BMC ADDM/Discovery

## New
* Tested on v11.3 of BMC Discovery.
* Generic Query now floats with top bar + some minor improvements to layout so that it's not squishing on elements.
* Generic Query will now automatically fill in the 'raw query' string of a generated report.
* Have added an experimental feature that improves TPL file editing in appliance.

## Features

* Update the banner colour to cover the header - easier identification of appliance
* Sets the tab title to the name of the appliance automatically - easier to work with multiple tabs/appliances
* Automatically switch between debug mode on/off
* One-click hide debug output (with debug mode on)
* Adds a global generic search query box
* Adds 'refine results' bar to top of reports pages
* Converts TPL module page into a lightweight editor - does not require page reload or 'edit' button!

Contributions and Feedback welcome.
