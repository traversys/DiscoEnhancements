# DiscoEnhancements for BMC Discovery
## Version 1.6
### traversys.io

This modest extension aims to bring some useful enhancements to the Discovery UI.

Supports version 12.x of BMC ADDM/Discovery.

## New

* Convert UI 'simple' attributes to taxonomy attributes
* Updated for version 12.x (should still work on 11.x, but not tested)
* Fixed slight misalignment of Big Version box with header
* Removed some older functionality (v9/10)
* Removed Firefox Gecko manifest statement
* ~~Global Dashboard dropdown.~~
* ~~CMDB Sync and Taxonomy tool icons added to navigation bar.~~

## Features

* Update the banner colour to cover the header - easier identification of appliance
* Sets the tab title to the name of the appliance automatically - easier to work with multiple tabs/appliances
* Automatically switch between debug mode on/off
* One-click hide debug output (with debug mode on)
* Adds a global generic search query box
* Adds 'refine results' bar to top of reports pages
* Converts TPL module page into a lightweight editor - does not require page reload or 'edit' button!

## Wishlist

* Improve the method of identifying Discovery
* Full colour editor and line numbers for TPL
* Link from DiscoveryAccess to Platform Scripts page
* Dashboard dropdown from anywhere
* Copy functions for Name attributes
* Query output as plaintext CSV format
* Easier taxonomy lookup
* Quicker TPL file upload (selection)
* Store Discovery profiles (different settings for different appliances)
* Dark mode
